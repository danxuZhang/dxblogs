Deploy HomeLab services and self-hosting with Ansible and Kubernetes, automate with ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi Pico.\nMulti-Column Vector Search in MyRocks. Extend MyRocks, MySQL database with RocksDB storage engine, to support multi-column topK vector search by efficiently traversing multiple vector indexes inspired by Microsoft VBase.\nPast Projects # Accelerating ICON with OpenACC. Part of ISC24 Student Competition, accelerated ICON grupel simulation with OpenACC by parallelizing and offloading computation to GPU, optimizing memory movements and cache utilization.\nBusTub. CMU 15-445 Intro to DBMS Project.\nTextSpotter. A Tesseract and EAST Backed Text Detection and Matching library.\nDigital Lung Scoring. Full-stack web application for scoring Lung samples using Django and React.\nHPC Competitions # SC24 @ Atlanta, USA # Highest Linpack Benchmark Award: achieved 236 TFLOPS with 8x H100 under 4.5 kW power constraints;\nHardware and System Administration: setup and managed a cluster of 3 nodes connected by 400Gbps Infiniband network, tuned system performance for benchmarks(HPL, MLPerf, NASA Parallel Benchmark);\nHPC Application: configured and ran weather model ICON for global weather simulation, profiled I/O and optimized MPI communication.\nISC24 @ Hamburg, Germany # Third Place in Online Component;\nHardware and System Administration: setup and managed a cluster of 3 nodes connected by 200Gbps Infiniband network, tuned system performance for benchmarks(HPL, HPCG, HPCC);\nCoding Challenge: accelerated weather model ICON\u0026rsquo;s grupel simulation speed 37x times compared to baseline by parallelizing and offloading computation to GPU and optimizing memory access and cache utilization.\nHPC Application: configured and ran fluid simulation application with OpenLB, compared scalability for both multi-node CPU and GPU.\n2023 APAC HPC-AI Competition # Third Place\nHPC Application: configured and optimized weather model MPAS-atmosphere;\nAI Application: optimized Large Language Model Bloom inference.\n","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"dxBlogs","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"10 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"dxBlogs","summary":"","title":"dxBlogs","type":"page"},{"content":" Hello, World # This is my first post!\n","date":"9 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My First Post","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
